    As a history major, I primarily studied former communist countries, specifically Eastern Europe and Russia.
    I wrote a research proposal on the role that the Soviet Union played in helping (or not helping) Cuba develop.
    Additionally, I wrote a research paper comparing the civil defense systems of the United States and the
    Soviet Union.

    I self taught myself to do web development in 2007, starting with a PHP tool used to supplement the experience of an
    online game. I expanded this through a variety of web projects throughout high school including an interactive
    biography of Victor Hugo, increasing awareness of prostate cancer, and a program to help students find tutors. In
    college, I went through the introductory computer science courses and data structures and algorithms. The most
    valuable class I took was Client-Side Web Development, which allowed me to dive deeper into modern web development
    tools including AngularJS, ReactJS, and Boostrap.

    Throughout my 4 years at the University, I assisted in the technical development of various clubs including the
    University of Washington - League of Legends (PCM), ABSA, and WASMUN. I also spend a lot of time helping out at
    various Model UN conferences around the US in both administrative and substantive matters. I have worked and
    written papers on a variety of topics most notably on the role of cyber-terorrism and the illicit trade of firearms.
    These experiences were key to helping me get my first job was a front-end web developer at Tanstandar Inc and my
    current position at Amazon.

    I love to learn new things and I am a hard and ambitious worker. I enjoy finding ways to use technology to solve
    problems in both my professional and personal life.
